# Data Engineering & Systems Portfolio

This repository contains a small set of **practical, production‑style projects** focused on data engineering, system organization, and process reliability.

The projects here reflect real‑world work where:
- Requirements are incomplete or messy
- Data comes from multiple systems
- Structure and clarity have to be designed, not assumed

Each project is self‑contained and includes source code, documentation, and context explaining the problem being solved.

## Projects in This Repository

### 1. COBRA Eligibility & Event Processing Pipeline
**SQL + Python**

An end‑to‑end data pipeline that generates **vendor‑compliant COBRA eligibility files** from HR, benefits, and dependent data.

This project focuses on:
- Complex SQL logic using CTEs and window functions
- Translating business and compliance rules into deterministic code
- Generating synthetic benefit records based on eligibility
- Final file validation and cleanup using Python

📁 Includes SQL transformations, Python cleaning scripts, and sample outputs.

### 2. ERP Documentation & SharePoint Organization System
**Process Design + Information Architecture**

A documentation hub built to replace an unstructured, ad‑hoc approach to ERP knowledge management.

This project focuses on:
- Designing a scalable folder and naming convention
- Turning tribal knowledge into searchable documentation
- Creating clear ownership and lifecycle expectations for files
- Improving onboarding and support efficiency through structure

📁 Includes documentation standards, folder conventions, and site‑level guidance.

---

### 3. Additional Data & Systems Project
**SQL / Python / Systems Work**

A supporting project demonstrating additional experience working with:
- Data extraction and transformation
- System integration or reporting
- Validation, troubleshooting, or process automation

📁 Includes source files and documentation describing the problem and approach.

## How to Navigate This Repo

- Each project lives in its own folder
- Each project includes its own README explaining details and decisions
- The top‑level README (this file) is meant to provide **context**, not implementation detail

If you are reviewing this repository:
- Start with the project READMEs
- Skim the SQL and Python for complexity and structure
- Focus on how problems are framed and solved, not just syntax

## About This Portfolio

This repository is intentionally **small and focused**.  
The goal is to show:
- How I think through messy systems
- How I translate business rules into code
- How I design structure where none existed before

It reflects production‑style constraints rather than academic examples.
