# Infor ERP Team – Documentation Hub

## Why This Site Exists

This SharePoint site was created to centralize Infor ERP documentation.

(Examples of documentation I have created can be found in the other files in this directory)

Before this site was established, documentation was:
- Spread across personal folders, emails, and shared drives
- Inconsistently named and difficult to search
- Largely undocumented or dependent on tribal knowledge

There was no defined structure for where files should live or how they should be named, which made onboarding, troubleshooting, and support inefficient.

This site introduces a **clear, consistent organizational system** so information is easy to find, maintain, and trust.

---

## How This Site Is Organized

Documentation is grouped by purpose using a numbered folder structure to keep content consistent and predictable.

```

1.  Procedures
2.  Templates
3.  Architecture
4.  Configuration
5.  Integrations
6.  Workflows & Processes
7.  Troubleshooting & Errors
8.  Temporary Files and Testing

```

Each folder has a specific role and should be used intentionally.

## Folder Descriptions

**1. Procedures**  
Finalized SOPs and step‑by‑step operational documentation.

**2. Templates**  
Standard templates used to create consistent documentation.

**3. Architecture**  
High‑level system diagrams, data flows, and design references.

**4. Configuration**  
System settings, environment notes, and configuration details.

**5. Integrations**  
Inbound and outbound integrations, file feeds, and APIs.

**6. Workflows & Processes**  
End‑to‑end business and technical process documentation.

**7. Troubleshooting & Errors**  
Known issues, error explanations, and resolutions.

**8. Temporary Files and Testing**  
Non‑authoritative files used for testing or validation.

## File Naming Conventions

Files should follow a consistent naming pattern to improve searchability and clarity:

```

DOC\_<System>*<Process>*<Topic>
SOP\_<System>*<Process>*<Topic>

```

This allows files to be understood without opening them.

---

## Expectations

- This site is the **source of truth** for ERP documentation
- Content should be placed in the correct folder
- Temporary or test files should not live outside designated locations
- If documentation does not fit the structure, the structure should be reviewed

---

## Outcome

This site replaces an unstructured documentation approach with a scalable, maintainable system that:
- Improves onboarding
- Reduces support time
- Preserves institutional knowledge
- Supports continuity and audit readiness
