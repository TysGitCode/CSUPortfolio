# Edge URL Selector — Guest Profile Launcher (Qt / PySide6)

A modern, professional desktop utility that lets you **select multiple URLs**, **drag to set launch order**, and open them in **separate Microsoft Edge windows** using **guest-like profiles** (`--user-data-dir`) — ideal for quickly launching environment-specific portals (PRD / TST / TRN / PP1) without session collisions.

This was created as a solution for an issue on the infor team that prevented us from having more than 2 enviornments open at a time. 

> Built with **PySide6 (Qt)** for a polished UI and scalable model/view architecture.
